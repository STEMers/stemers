Alina: understanding STEMers features and find a way to realize it.

## Start Doing

Alina:

- build data model and test it, find out a data model fits for STEMers.
- writing frontend code

## Lessons Learned

Alina: Don't limit yourself to do new things. when you start doing it, the success is not far.

## Strategy vs. Board

Alina: we don't lose any group member this week.

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

## Week 4

## Stop Doing

- Believing that if you do not know how to code you do not contribute

## Continue Doing

- Learning while doing
- Alina: writing frontend code

## Start Doing

- Follow up on planning
- Alina:
  - sign in/ sign up page
  - stars page
  - profile page

## Lessons Learned

- Alina: result oriented develop. don't worry about what is the best code to develop a feature. first build a feature based on your current skill level and make sure it works . in the future you'll learn more, then you can rewrite the code with more elegant code.

---

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

- Alina:
  - sign in/ sign up feature
  - filter stars by country and category
  - display avatar

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

- Alina:
  - log in with LinkedIn feature. register app and working with Oauth
  - remember me feature. how to make suer remember me consistently work? what if a user remembered a wrong identifier or password, what if a user has changed the identifier or password. It's not a simple remember me. it's a remember me system.

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- We have choosen to put more focus into having a small but working website because with the group reduced it would not be possile to do everything we had in mind

---

## Week 5

## Stop Doing

Alina: adding new feature in STEMers.

## Continue Doing

Alina: reduce code and fix bugs.

## Start Doing

## Lessons Learned
