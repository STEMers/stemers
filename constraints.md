# Constraints

Some boundaries around our project.

## External

<!--
  constraints coming from the outside that your team has no control over. these may include:
  - project deadlines
  - UI design or color schemes
  - technologies (sometimes a client will tell you what to use)
-->

## Internal: Involuntary

Our group has become smaller and currently we are trying to do our best to accomplish our mission with life happening on the side.


## Internal: Voluntary

We have talked about what issue are more important so we can deliver small but with everything working as it should rather than buiding to big and have to many missing parts
