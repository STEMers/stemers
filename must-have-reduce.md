	 // why nominate star?  Do we distinguish women by stars(eg.1-5star), or by nominate(yes/no)  
	// If must, How nominate star? step by step  
	// what is featured stars? does it mean a preview a list of women which is sorted by stars?  
18.As a user, I can see invitation section for inviting more people to the platform. +

7.As a user, I can create, edit, delete comments for STEMers   
  // what does comment look like(UI),
8.As a user, I can see all comments in the platform  
 // why do you want to see all comments? coments are not independent object, it's alway need to about something. eg. about this woman. so view comments about a woman below her profile isn’t enough?   
 // could remove 8 (suggestion)
15.As a user, I can see footer section in all pages with social media links   
// why in all pages? eg. where does the social link on login, home page go?
